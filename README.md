# EC400 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence which deals with learning from repeated interactions with an environment. Reinforcement learning is the basis for state-of-the-art algorithms for playing strategy games such as Chess, Go, Backgammon, and Starcraft, as well as a number of problems throughout robotics, operations research, and other fields of engineering. In this course, we will study the fundamental algorithms of reinforcement learning. Our goal will be to understand the principles underlying these algorithms and to test them on several popular benchmarks.
